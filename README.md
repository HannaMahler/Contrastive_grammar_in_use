# Contrastive_grammar_in_use
This repository contains the material related to the analysis reported in my PhD thesis, "Contrastive grammar in use: Quantitative perspectives on the verb phrase in English and German".
Due to copyright reasons I am unfortunately not allowed to make all of the data taken from the GECCo corpus (Kunz et al. 2021) publicly available here. It is therefore not possible to reproduce all steps of my procedure with the files provided here. The main parts (descriptive and inferential statistics) can, however, be reproduced. 
Researchers interested in my project can contact me and request a complete set of my files.
